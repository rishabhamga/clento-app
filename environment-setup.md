## üîß Fixing the Clerk Redirect Issue

The issue where users are redirected to `mighty-stingray-65.accounts.dev/default-redirect` instead of localhost is caused by missing Clerk redirect environment variables.

### Solution:
1. **Add the redirect URLs above to your `.env.local` file**
2. **In your Clerk Dashboard:**
   - Go to https://dashboard.clerk.com
   - Navigate to your application
   - Go to **User & Authentication** ‚Üí **Email, Phone, Username**
   - Scroll down to **Redirect URLs**
   - Add these URLs:
     - `http://localhost:3000/onboarding` (for development)
     - `http://localhost:3001/onboarding` (backup port)
     - `https://your-domain.com/onboarding` (for production)

### 3. For Development Environment:
```bash
# Make sure your app is running on the correct port
npm run dev

# If port 3000 is taken, it will use 3001 - update Clerk accordingly
```

## üé® Theme Fixes Applied

‚úÖ **Fixed blue color theme issues:**
- Updated "Analyzing Your Website" text color to use gradient theme
- Changed progress bar from blue to purple theme
- Updated all blue color references in onboarding wizard
- Fixed campaign pitch page blue colors
- Maintained consistent purple gradient theme throughout

## üß™ Testing the Setup

### Test Clerk Authentication Flow:
1. Start your development server: `npm run dev`
2. Visit `/sign-up` to create a test account
3. Verify redirect goes to `/onboarding` (not accounts.dev)
4. Complete onboarding flow
5. Verify redirect to `/dashboard`

### Test Website Analysis:
1. Go through onboarding
2. Enter a website URL for analysis
3. Verify the color theme is consistent (purple, not blue)
4. Check that analysis completes successfully

## üöÄ Production Deployment

When deploying to production (Vercel, etc.):
1. Add all environment variables to your deployment platform
2. Update Clerk redirect URLs to use your production domain
3. Use production Clerk keys (replace `pk_test_` with `pk_live_`)
4. Use production Supabase project URLs

## üîë Getting API Keys

### Clerk:
1. Visit https://dashboard.clerk.com
2. Create/select your application
3. Go to **API Keys** to get your publishable and secret keys

### Supabase:
1. Visit https://supabase.com
2. Create/select your project
3. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **API** to get your URLs and keys
